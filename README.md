## Simple PDO

A simple and secure database abstraction layer which utilizes the PDO interface and supports working with multiple databases.

Simple PDO was designed to provide a collection of functions which ensure safe and secure database queries 
with a simple-to-use interface without compromising speed - all the while supporting simultaneous connections of multiple databases.

Simple PDO also utilizes prepared statements using named bindings to protect against SQL injections.
